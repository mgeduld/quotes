Effective use of chapters/sections to create tension isn't emphasized nearly enough. Makes or breaks a novel, much of the time. 

...  each chapter should answer one question, whilst asking another two. So the reader constantly feels like they are progressing towards an answer, but the answer keeps getting more complex, keeps getting further away from them. 

... one of the questions you ask, typically the one at the end of the chapter, should have an immediate pull, a kind of mini cliffhanger. (What's going to happen next? How are they going to get out of that one? What is she going to say?)

The second question, which you may choose to conceal in the middle of the chapter so the reader is barely aware of it, is likely to be more long term, perhaps even abstract (Is victory worth it at any cost? What is the value of a human life? Will those two ever get together or will they always be apart?)

That way, your structure both has an immediate cliffhanger pull (wanting to know what will happen right in the next chapter) and a more overarching pull (wanting to know how the novel as a whole will turn out).

Quieter chapters will ask/answer the second kind of question. Faster paced/action chapters will focus more on the first kind of question. Alternating the two different kinds of chapters creates a satisfying variance.

This is all a massive simplification, but a good starting point. Good TV (The Wire, Breaking Bad etc.) is great to study this kind of thing.

... you can't end every chapter on a super cliffhanger or they lose their effect. Using a chapter ending to linger on a significant moment and ask a subtle question is great too, and balancing the two together... that's the real trick.
