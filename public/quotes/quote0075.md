Dreaming awake, as I've called it, means being fully conscious while tapping into the sub-conscious or dream mind. This is what any creative writer does. Writers have been doing this for centuries before Breton stumbled upon Freud. Anything that seems a bit odd is labeled surrealism. So many so-called surrealistic poems come across as stylized fakes, as very conscious attempts to be strange. My desire has always been to argue the case for reality. A good example is found in the works of Kafka, who explored the vaunted dreamscape, and yet was able to report it in rational and reasoned language. Language is sanity. We all teeter on the border of dream and consciousness. To pretend insanity is insulting, both to the clinically insane, and to those of us who strive for reality. Dreams, no matter how absurd or strange, are believable because they make physical sense. It's the same creative process as found in poems. The big difference is that dreams are almost totally without language. Still the poem and the dream arise from the same place. It's a place of image and gesture. Which makes a poem a miraculous contradiction. Which also makes the writing of the same an act of sanity; whole-brain thinking. Language is consciousness, but the source of the creative is not. It's all a kind of dreaming awake. Again, whole-brain thinking.

...

there is a dirty little secret about dreams: they are mostly, if not entirely non-verbal. Dreams create their art works at night in a language of signs, images, gestures and metaphor, all in a dumb show. The subconscious doesn't know how to speak in the conscious language. Trying to put a dream into words is like trying to translate a painting into words. This is the difficulty with poetry. The poet has to create into language something that has no language. Dreaming awake, as I've called it, means being fully conscious while also dreaming. Not falling asleep on the job, but with a conscious eye to composition; the good editor, as it were. Insanity is always at the elbow, and so I try for order on the page. The insane lose that border between the subconscious and consciousness, and come to frozen laughter.

...

My approach is to grasp the seemingly irrational and to make something rational of it. To enter sanity by entering sanity's back door.

I write as a reader, not knowing what the author will say next.
