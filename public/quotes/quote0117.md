My skill as a director ... come\[s] from an interest in the observation of the totally negligible. ... I've learned gradually as time's gone on that the things we think of the most important or the most significant are really large heaps of trivial detail, and that's where the treasure is. The treasure is to be found in the little nuance of behavior.

... I think I share that interest with my mother, who was a novelist who observed with great subtlety and liked trivial detail. ... I've always had an enormous admiration for Flaubert; for Emma Bovery. You can't imagine a more trivial slut than Emma Bovery, and yet the heaps of minuscule trivial detail which Flaubert heaps together to give the life of this otherwise negligible trollop significance and importance makes it into a work of great art.

... It's what a director's work consists of. ... Most of the important work ... consists of nothing more than reminding people of what they knew all along but had forgotten. You have to say, 'Have you ever noticed how, when people are thinking, they will sometimes be talking to you and \[scratching their eyes]?'
 
And they say, 'Yes, of course.'

And I say, 'Well, do that, please. Why don't you do that on the stage since you do it all the time in life?'
 
Or running your hand around the edge of a glass while thinking and talking to somebody.
 
When I did the *Merchant of Venice,* \[Laurence Olivier\] wanted to have a moment of triumph when he heard Antionio's ships had gone down. ... And he said to me, 'Dear boy, we must think of a spectacular thing to do here.'
 
I said, 'It needn't be spectacular in order to be interesting. Why don't do you something quite trivial but odd? ... Listen, there's a moment of triumph in a newsreel I'll show of you of Hitler doing a dance, a little dance of triumph, in the railway at Compi√®gne at the surrender of France. He just suddenly does a little jig. It's over in about ten seconds. ... Just do that.'

... Those trivial details, when all put together, you realize that's all our life consists of. It just consists of a mosaic of tiny behaviors with which we present ourselves to others.
