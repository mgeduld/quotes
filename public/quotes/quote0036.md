We should agree to discuss nothing that could be acted out â€¦ Brecht would say he wanted no discussion in rehearsal \[everything] ... would have to be tried ... The best argument may be a testimony to the skill of the presenter rather than to the excellence of the solution advocated. Also the bulk of discussion time is visibly taken up with transactions of status which have nothing to do with the problem being solved. My attitude is like Edison's, who found a solvent for rubber by putting bits of rubber in every solution he could think of, and beat all those scientists who were approaching the problem theoretically.
