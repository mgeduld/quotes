Marlon Brando: I am so ambivalent about the arts, so to speak, and the artists, so to speak, because I don't always see the true relationship of art to artists existing.

JG: And that is?

Marlon Brando: Art is not a thing that is picked up and utilized, like a tool or a toy. Art is a relationship between a human being who is open to the idea of a relationship with the divine. And I don't know if this divine thing, for lack of a better word, is God or energy or an idea or the congregation of all people who have sought and sustained this divine relationship. I don't know, nor do I care: I just want to be connected to this divine force when I work--and even when I don't.

JG: How?

Marlon Brando: Well, you connect first with the writer, who, if he is Tennessee \[Williams] or Shakespeare, clearly had a line, forged by emotion and desire and an urge to escape the human and the conventional, to something divine. Tennessee claimed it was God, or a God he had fashioned for himself. It was supernatural for him, and it pulled him away from the earth and its picayune needs and activities. If I connect to Tennessee, then I am no longer common or interested in the usual things--prestige or appearance or comparison. I am tapped into something divine.

JG: But Shakespeare wasn't at MGM when you made 'Julius Caesar.'

Marlon Brando: Yes, he was. Because I brought him there with me everyday. It is very metaphysical--acting, singing, writing, painting. As humans we can make a fire or fuck or walk down a street to where the food is, but if we wish to amplify our humanity, if we wish to connect to other people and enhance our lives and theirs, we have to utilize all our strengths as humans to rise above our station. And I can only believe that art does this for us. And I can tell when someone is tapped into this divine strength when they work. Otherwise, they are just a performer, and if you really want to piss me off and disconnect from me completely, identify me as a performer. A monkey can be taught to use the hula hoop, and that is a performer. I am not a performer. A lot of people I worked with aren't far above that ape, let me tell you: They learn lines and they look cute and they hit their marks and take their checks. That is not an artist, and I hated working with those people, because they desecrated the experience, which should be, bear with me, holy. You can see why I was so loathed and avoided in those years when people wanted to work with me, because I was on a calling, and that made me appear to be quite crazy. Or totally crazy. I don't think I'm crazy when I identify art as holy, and the creation and husbanding of it as a holy mission or calling. And when the business people who run our industries of so-called art only wanted me to show up and do what I was told with as little concentration or care as possible, I decided that if they were going to deprive me of my dignity and my holy calling, I was going to deprive them of as much of their money as I legally could.

Art is holy. Artists, if they work properly, are holy--within their work. And this is not discussed or studied. What is studied is the vocation of a business, and this degrades the entire process.
