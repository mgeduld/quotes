I do clubs, unannounced, and start with zero jokes. Struggle, have a bunch of bad sets ... Even at the \[Comedy] Cellar, when people recognize me and are happy to see me, I'm like, 'Here comes new jokes,' and that \[happiness] evaporates. No one pretends to laugh at you. No one will pretend to laugh at you.

So the first couple of jokes, they go, 'What?' And I usually try opening with stuff that ...  isn't going to work, probably ...

Ok. Here we are. I don't want to be here. It's like ... if you're in the gym. You don't go to the gym to have a good time. And you get into 'I'm proud of myself that I'm at the gym today,' but the first moves you make, you're like, 'This fucking sucks!'

You get through a shitty ten minutes of jokes, and \[you realize that] you've maybe got one \[good] joke. So you do that night after night until you've got ten, twenty ...

And then after you have twenty minutes, and you've done it a few times, if you have the discipline, you stop doing those jokes, and you start again with a new twenty. From nothing. 

The way I usually do it, I end up with two twenty-minute sets, and then I start mixing them a little bit. And then I start going to stuff in the notebook that never worked and never should have worked--or things I was too scared to try ... 

You know when you write something in your notes for a new comedy set, and  when you look at it, you think, 'I ain't doing that' ... I'm not touching that!'? I always have a set when I'm developing where I go, 'You have do ...*only* those, now.' Only things that you shouldn't be doing or things that have gotten silence. It's like this is the last chance for those bits. Tonight. And no bits that have been getting laughs. That's a rough set. 

But if anything makes it out of it ... Some of those bits have wound up being the best bits. Always, the best bits I have in a special ... the ones that are like 'That just kills every time,' started with silent ... hate it! ... hate it! ...
