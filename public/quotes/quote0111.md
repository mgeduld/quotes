 I have to say this, because it has been on my mind for many years now: I know that actors have to work, have to pay their bills, and I know how difficult it is to balance the artistic life with the mechanics of working and paying bills and staying afloat. However, and I speak with some experience on this, I must say that an artist should never work in an environment that offers the illusion that they are somehow, by osmosis or bi-weekly payment, already an artist. I've had students who work in clerical positions at theatre companies, and they come to believe that they are 'working' in the theatre. You are *not* working in the theatre, unless your goal is to be a secretary for someone in a theatre. I see writers toiling in a publishing house, and they think, 'Well, I'm sort of involved in writing.' No! You are involved in someone else's writing. There is an illusion that working in a museum confers artistic status upon a person, when you are really a guard or a sales clerk. You must separate your artistic endeavors from your means of support, and your primary means of survival--emotional survival--must be artistic. Drive a truck; bake bread; give massages; wait tables. Do whatever you must to get by and that will allow you to give your all--your artistic all--to your artistic endeavors. The only job to which you must submit your all is that of an actor. I promise you it can be done.
