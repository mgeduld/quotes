Self-acceptance is terribly difficult and is, not that you asked, the primary obsession of mine. It is the ultimate sin, you'll find, to ignore or to deny who and what we are. As a human tragedy. As an artist insanity. One's style, whatever that is, is simply the only way we can communicate or share. To apply a style, like a rancid batter, is folly. Tell your story in the only way you can. One of the most potent ways to discover and to accept yourself is to tell your story honestly. There you will find yourself.
