When there's a revolutionary or extremist moment, the first target of the extremists often isn't the other side, it's ... the in-group moderate of their own side. ... You have to purge the near-enemy or the in-group moderate to create the solidarity necessary to fight the next battle.

And when you see that phenomenon, you see it everywhere. Some of the most vicious canceling you see is blue on blue or red on red. In fact, it's pretty hard for blue to cancel red or red to cancel blue, because [when you're attacked by the other group] you have that community that will rally to your side.
