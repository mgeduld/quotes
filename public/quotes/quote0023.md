I read until I find something that just doesn’t make sense. Not just an 'I’m a bit confused' feeling but a more confounding sense of 'I don’t understand how this is even possible. It violates my very understanding of how the world is meant to work.'

That happens surprisingly quickly in fields I’ve absolutely no idea about. And then I just focus on understanding how that one particular thing could be true. I’ll often find this forces me to correct some incorrect assumptions, which may be blocking my ability to learn more productively due to subconscious second-guessing and a mismatch with my world view.
