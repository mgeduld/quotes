I wrote another assignment, about Flogstad's aesthetics, and reckoned in fact I had cracked the code. Academic writing was actually about hiding what you didn't know. There was language, a technique, and I had mastered it. In everything there were gaps, which language could cover over, so long as you had acquired the know-how. I had, for instance, never read Adorno, knew practically nothing about the Frankfurt School, just the snippets I had picked up here and there, but in an assignment I could maneuver the little knowledge I actually had in such a way as to make it appear greater and more comprehensive. Another technique that was held in high regard was the ability to transfer knowledge from one field to another, preferably in a surprising way, this, too, was simple, all you had to do was build a bridge between them and then your work seemed to have a new original element, even though actually there was nothing new or original in it.
