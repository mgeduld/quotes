If I'm forced to suggest something about the deeper meaning of the story \[of *Full Metal Jacket*], ... I would have to say that it has a lot to do with the Jungian idea of the duality of man: altruism and cooperation onÂ one hand, and aggression and xenophobia on the other.

I suppose the single improvement one might hope for in the world, which would have the greatest effect for good, would be an appreciation and acceptance of this Jungian view of man by those who see themselves as good and externalize all evil.
