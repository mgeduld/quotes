Whenever you hear something or you see something, and you have this intense reaction of, 'I love it! This is awesome!' or a really intense negative reaction, like, 'I hate this! It's stupid!' or 'I hate that person,' or whatever, those are the moments to just stop. 

Use the intensity of your affect as a queue to stop and interrogate what's going on. 

If you love something--you're reading something or you're hearing something on the news, maybe, or you're watching a Youtube video or whatever--and you *love* it, whatever was just said validates some deeply-held belief that you have. And whenever you hear something that you hate, it just *violated* some deeply held belief that you have. 

So stop. And take a moment, and think about it. Try to observe what's going on. If you pause before the heat of the moment has you in its grip, you will make better decisions. ... Use your affect as a queue, a barometer, that this might be time to slow down and take stock.
