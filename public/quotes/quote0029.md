If you know where a story is going, don't hoard it. Make the story go there, now. But then what? What will you do next? You've surrendered your big reveal. Exactly. Often, in our doubts that we have a real story to tell, we hold something back, fearing that we don't have anything else. And this can be form of trickery. Surrendering that thing is a leap of faith that forces the story to attention, saying to it, in effect, 'You have to do better than that, and now that I've denied you your trick, your first-order solution, I know that you will.'

... A work of art moves us by being honest and that honesty is apparent it its language and its forms and in its resistance to concealment.
