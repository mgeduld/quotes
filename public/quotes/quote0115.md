I really love film dweebs. How can you not adore someone who upon meeting you names how many movies Theda Bara starred in and how many are still in existence? I am not saying you would want to date such a person. Seriously, how long can you get through life with virtually no social skills and the distorted reality that people should be impressed with your knowledge of silent movie trivia? But you do have to love these people.
