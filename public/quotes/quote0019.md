\[Shakespeare] is often accused of inconsistency and contradiction. Yet 'contradiction' seems the key word for me in Shakespeare: the actor should always embrace that. Human beings contradict themselves all the time. ... If you find a contradiction in a speech you have to ask 'why', what clues does it give you; but don't dodge the challenge by cutting it.
