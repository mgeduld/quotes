Cordelia says, 'Think of ten stacks of plates. Those are your ten chances.' Every time I do something wrong, a stack of plates comes crashing down. I can see these plates. Cordelia can see them too, because she's the one who says _Crash_! Grace can see them a little, but her crashes are tentative, she looks to Cordelia for confirmation. Carol tries a crash once or twice but is scoffed at: '_That_ wasn't a crash!'

'Only four left,' says Cordelia. 'You better watch yourself. Well?'

I say nothing.

'Wipe that smirk off your face,' says Cordelia.

I say nothing.

'Crash!' says Cordelia. 'Only three left.'

Nobody ever says what will happen if all the stacks of plates fall down.
