Have you tried emphasizing the flaws \[in your writing]? Or rather, what you see as flaws? It's a totally different approach.
  
I'm thinking of Kafka. His writing doesn't have a lot of punch on a sentence to sentence basis. He wrote like a law clerk because he was one. Of course, it was in stark contrast to his subject so it worked, but, nevertheless, not a lot of punch. He turned what one might see as a negative, emphasized it and made it work. Beckett is another example. He saw nobody could ever put more into a novel than Joyce did, so he emphasized this shortcoming and went the other way and stripped out everything he could to great success.

Take a deep long look at your writing and analyze the flaws. Stop trying to fix them and emphasize them as much as you can. You will turn the problem on its head and your conflict will change one way or another. Either you will like what you are writing and can run with it, or you will hate it and see how you can improve it.
