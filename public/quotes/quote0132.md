\[A student] ... was constantly painting with a palette knife, very heavy, impasto, just like Van Gogh. 

And he knew he was doing nothing but trying to emulate this master, and, at the same time, because he was all of 19, there's that urge to have your own style. 

And he's complaining to the teacher, 'I don't know what my own style is. I just keep ... trying to be Van Gogh.' 

And the teacher said, 'I have an idea.' ... 

There was a museum that was adjunct to the school, actually part of the school, that actually had a little Van Gogh in it. He set it up for this fellow to go in there with his canvas and his paints, his little easel, right next to the Van Gogh. 

And he said, 'I want you to go in and copy it exactly. And just know that everything you get wrong is your style.'
