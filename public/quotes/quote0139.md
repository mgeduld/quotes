I suspect that your reasoning is predicated on a misunderstanding of what a social construct is. You seem to be conflating it with something that isn't real, or doesn't matter. Nothing further from the truth. (BTW, food is arguably a social construct, as it is a somewhat arbitrary distinction between types of organic matter. Plants and animals are not social constructs. They are physical things with definable characteristics. There are always some species that challenge our systems of categorization (and those systems _are_ social constructs), but plants and animals themselves are what they are independent of an observing society.)

For example, the United State government is a social construct. There is no physical object in the world that is the US government. It exists purely because society agrees that it exists, and operates accordingly. However, the US government has enormous impact in the physical world. It can deploy military power, print money, allocate resources to social programs that feed families, etc. etc. etc.

Gender is also a social construct. It is, at its core, the litany of associations one makes with a given sex (sex is not a social construct, more on that in a bit) in a given society. For example, we associate the color blue with baby boys and pink with girls, while in India pink is considered the more masculine color. Men are typically more war-like, while women are the peacemakers. Women have more association with self-decoration (through clothing, jewelry, makeup, etc.) while men are typically more utilitarian with their appearances. None of these associations are mandated by any law of physics; they aren't _real_ properties of the sexes. They are simply the associations one draws with the sexes in western society, and as such have real impact on the world in terms of how people behave, what they buy, and how we treat and view one another.

Sex, as you say, is not a social construct. It is dictated by ones chromosomal makeup and physical characteristics.

So, what happens when a person with male sex views themselves with the womanly associations (gender)? They are then a transgendered person. While their sex is male, their gender (everything society attaches to sex) is that of a woman. That part I think you already understand.

So, what happens when someone doesn't particularly identify with either set of associations and assumptions? Neither seems to fit, or both fit in roughly equal measure? While 'male' or 'female' will still be accurate words to describe this person, 'man' and 'woman' are inaccurate. This person will then require a different word with which to self-identify.

The purpose of language is to communicate ideas. If I say 'I am a man,' I am communicating that I, by and large, behave and appear within the parameters of the masculine gender role in my society. Similar with the statement, 'I am a woman.' If I do not truly behave and appear in a way consistent with either gender role's parameters, then both of these statements will be false. As I still wish the communicate my identity, I will therefore require words that accurately convey it. This is the purpose non-binary genders serve. Its the same purpose the binary genders serve: a broad concept-space into which many social associations are packed, to convey a lot of information about yourself (or someone else) in shorthand.

EDIT: There is another reason, perhaps the greater, why it is important to recognize the validity of someone's gender identity, regardless of what it is.

Respect.

To state or imply that someone's gender identity simply does not exist is enormously, hideously disrespectful to them as a fellow sapient being. Gender is something we humans place a (probably too) great deal of stock in. Our gender is important to us. Along with ethnic heritage, sexuality, and religious affiliations, gender identity is one of those Big Fucking Deal things people (perhaps mistakenly, but that's another discussion) place at or near the core of their identities.

If someone says they're Puerto Rican, you don't say that's just a kind of Mexican. That's racist as fuck. If someone is bisexual, you don't say they're just gay. That's ignorant. If someone is Sikh, you don't call them a Muslim terrorist. You'd be wrong on a variety of levels there.

Similarly, if someone tells you their gender is some kind you're not familiar with, you should not assume that it doesn't exist, or imply that it is a sub-category of something you _are_ familiar with.

Official documentation should reflect this common respect among sapient beings by acknowledging everyone's right to simply fill out the damn box labelled 'Gender' with whatevery they wanna put down. If the boxes for religion were Muslim, Jewish, and Christian I'm sure the Hindus of the world would be rightfully pissed. A person who does not feel their government or society respects them or the class they belong to, they are far less likely to succeed within their society and much *more* likely to engage in criminal behavior. It is always to the good for society to respect its citizenry's right to self-identification.

*Person this was in response to: ... you're making my point, you're male or female, that's what i'm talking about, i don't care if you don't identify with the roles of your gender that doesn't change what you are, so why should an important document with identifiable information say that you're pangender or queer in the gender section?*

First let me address the disparity between the point you're currently making, and the overall thesis that non-binary genders are meaningless and useless. To be meaningless and useless, non-binary genders would have to serve _no_ function whatsoever. Your current point seems to be simply that they are not valuable information on legal documents. It is not necessary that I refute this point to assert that the concepts of non-binary genders have value: their value in communication of identity in common parlance I have already articulated in my top-level post.

I will refute it nonetheless.

\[You said] I don't care if you don't identify with the roles of your gender...

You don't have to care. However, there are quite a lot of people and institutions which very much _do_ care, and some for good reason.

Here are some examples:

The psychiatric and psychological care of those with gender dysphoria, and to some extent those with non-binary genders as well, is meaningfully different than those with clear binary genders. There are psychological care specialists who are more suited to caring for their needs, treatments that are better tuned to them, etc. It is therefore important that a psychological clinic's intake evaluation forms contain slots for both gender and sex. If such boxes did not allow for non-binary genders to be included, they would fail to record potentially valuable diagnostic/treatment information.

An employee is fired due to provably invidious discrimination against their non-binary gender. In other words, someone 'came out' as gender-queer, and was explicitly terminated because of this. Without their being any note of record indicating their non-binary gender, there is no case for discrimination.

Law enforcement is searching for an 'effeminate man', when the criminal was in fact an androgynous female with priors. Their investigation will be delayed by this misunderstanding. If only their records had indicated their non-binary gender accurately.

Obviously, these reductios are not proof in and of themselves. My point is this: to say that any datum has no value whatsoever is almost universally false. Any given datum will have value depending on what you're asking. Since it is impossible to anticipate every eventuality, it is better to record data faithfully than to ignore it and hope it never matters.
