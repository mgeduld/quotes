I remember reading something T.S. Eliot once said of another poet. In essence, he said his work was no good. You know why? Everything that should be conscious in his work, he leaves unconscious, and everything that should be unconscious he makes conscious. In many ways, you could say the same thing about bad acting.  
  
... Crafting an activity is something you must consciously *decide* to do. You choose a task. You give yourself a compelling reason to do it, a standard of perfection that creates an obstacle, and a reasonable sense of urgency ... After that? You dive in and get to work. And from there on, you can't control anything. Whatever happens between you and your partner while you're trying to work is freefall.  
  
... Bad actors leave things out in their crafting. They leave what should be conscious unconscious. Then they try to control what happens in the contact between themselves and their partners. They make what should be unconscious conscious. I tell you this: Craft your activities well ... and let what takes place in the contact be completely spontaneous and uncontrolled. Only then will that ninety percent of your personality which is submerged begin to surface.

Marcus Geduld's note: This is why it's vital to learn one's lines _perfectly_. It's part of the conscious work. Actors often learn their lines well-enough to fool an audience, but they have micro gaps of forgetfulness only they (and sometimes an observant director) are aware of. They know how to make these gaps look as if the *character* is searching for a word, which may even get them praise for evoking a sense realism.  
  
But what's happens during each one of these hitches is the actor gets pushed into consciousness. He's suddenly _thinking_ about his next word. He's trying to protect himself from looking like an ass on stage or in front of the camera. He's relieved when the word finally comes to him, just in time. It will then take him a moment to relax back into an unconscious, vulnerable state.
