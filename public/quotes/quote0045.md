The term prose poem at first glance may seem an oxymoron, until one remembers that the opposite of prose is verse. And that the opposite of poetry is fiction; that verse itself does not a poem make, nor does prose alone a fiction make. In simplified terms, fiction is consciousness language. Poetry is a thing of gesture and sign, and almost a non-language art. Poetry and fiction are two sides of the same coin. But neither succeeds without being something of the other. Pure poetry, for instance, is silence. It was fiction that taught poetry how to speak. The personal journey of the prose-poem writer recapitulates this process. It's a primitive pleasure enjoyed by intuitive simpletons.
