While his conscious mind stands amazed and empty before the phenomenon, \[the artist] is overwhelmed by a flood of thoughts and images which he never intended to create and which his own will could never have brought into being. Yet in spite of himself he is forced to admit that it is his own self speaking, his own inner nature revealing itself. ... He can obey the apparently alien impulse within him and follow where it leads, sensing that his work is greater than himself and wields a power which is not his and which he cannot command. Here the artist is not only identical with the process of creation, he is aware that he is subordinate to his work or stands outside it, as though he were a second person; or as though a person other than himself had fallen within the magic circle of an alien will.

... \[the artist's external life, however] interesting or inevitable ... is never essential to his creative task. ... \[He may be] a philistine, a good citizen, a fool, or a criminal, \[but his personal career] does not explain his art.
