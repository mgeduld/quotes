Everything is set up for children to attribute their first unsuccessful or unpleasant experience to their own disabilities. As a result, children percieve failure as relagating them either to the group of 'dumb people' or, more often, to a group of people 'dumb at x' ... Within this framework, children will define themselves in terms of their limitations, and this definition will be consolidated and reiforced throughout their lives. Only rarely does some exceptional event lead people to reorganize their intellectual self-image in such a way as to open up new perspectives on what is learnable.

Although these negative self-images can be overcome, in the life of an individual they are extremely robust and powerfully self-reinforcing. If people believe firmly enough that they cannot do math, they will usually succeed in prevent themselves from doing whatever they recognize as math. They consequences of such self-sabotage is personal failure, and each failure reinforces the original belief. And such beliefs may be most insidious when held not only by individuals, but by our entire culture.

... many children are held back in learning because they have a model of learning in which you have either 'got it' or 'got it wrong.' But when you learn to program a computer you almost never get it right the first time. Learning to be a master programmer is learning to become highly skilled at isolating and correcting 'bugs,' the parts that keep the program from working. The question to ask about the program is not whether it is right or wrong, but if it is fixable. If this way of looking at intellectual products were generalized to how the larger culture thinks about knowledge and its acquisition, we all might be less intimidated by our fears of 'being wrong.'
