There is no one way to \[approach character]. Everybody does it differently. For me, rather than tell the audience who the character is, I like to show the audience what a character wants. It all boils down to intentions and obstacles: somebody wants something and something is standing in their way of getting it. They want the girl, they want the money, they want to get to Philadelphia — it doesn’t matter, but they have to want it bad. Something formidable is in standing in their way, and the tactics that character uses to overcome the obstacle is going to define who the character is.
