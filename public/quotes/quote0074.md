The novel is a place where that reality we find ourselves in, which sometimes runs counter to the reality we talk about, can manifest in images. The novel can describe the world as it is, as opposed to the world it ought to be. Everyone who has read \[my novel] 'Out of the World' will understand that the emotions, urges, and desires that it contains are not something the author has made up but are something inside him. But the agreement between author and reader, the novel's pact, is that this conclusion should not be drawn, and if it is, only in secret. It should never be spoken aloud. The term 'novel' is the guarantee of that. Only in this way can what is not said but which is true still be said. That is the pact, the author is free to say whatever he or she wants because the author knows that what he or she says will never, or at least should never, be linked with the author, with his or her private person.
