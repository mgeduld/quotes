BLOOM: I think psychology has a lot to say about \[how the mind works]. On the other hand, I try to be honest .... A lot of our findings are not as robust as we thought they were. And I still believe, and I don't know who said it... Maybe Chomsky. ... You could learn a lot more from a good novel or a good TV series or a good movie \[than] from a psychology textbook.

If somebody was going to say, what's a marriage like? What's it like to raise teenagers? What's it like to grow old? I wouldn't point them to a psychology textbook. I'd point them to some good novels. 

HARRIS: Yeah, that's interesting. ... in recent years, I have arrived at that epiphany myself. There's so much to learn about human life through fiction, and it seems strange to say that because it is fiction. But what you're seeing are the best attempts of some of the smartest and most creative people to capture the substance of human experience. And some of the most compelling attempts at that are by definition what we have singled out as the most valuable forms of literature. And I guess we could add film and television here as well. ...It seems strange to say it, but it is in some cases our most accurate window on to at minimum the lives of others. 

BLOOM: Yeah. And I think a good writer, a good filmmaker has insights into the lives of others, often from their own experience. And there's something about it which is often more powerful and more transcendent than what you get through psychological research. You see a movie like Tar and you learn about artistic enterprise and about cancellation, about good and evil, the Banshees movie, the lovely meditation on friendship. And I don't know whether things will ever be different, whether \[there will] be a point where I'll say, no, no, check out the research, it'll tell you more. There's certainly things ... research could tell you that a novelist never could. And so maybe it's a matter of staying in our lane.
