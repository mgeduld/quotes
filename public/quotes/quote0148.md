Some people can write dialogue and some people can’t. I think most people can, because it’s just gossip. You make that up all day long. He said; she said. What happens \[is something] kicks in. Something artificial kicks in between what we do naturally and what we do when we say it’s art. And I think that thing which kicks in is called 'education.' Which is the worst thing that’s happened since kale.
