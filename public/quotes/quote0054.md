In my early thirties I saw myself as a Hemingwayesque realist. ... and everything I wrote was minimal and strict and efficient and lifeless and humor free, even though, in real life, I reflexively turned to humor at any difficult or important or awkward or beautiful moment. 

... One day \[while bored at work, I wrote] these dark Seussian poems. When I finished one, I'd draw a little cartoon to go along with it. ...I almost threw them out as I left work that day. But something stopped me. I brought them home, dropped them on the kitchen table, went off to see the kids. And then I heard, from the back of the table, the sound of genuine laughter, from my wife, as she'd read those stupid little poems. 

This was, I realized with a start, the first time in years that anyone had reacted to my writing with pleasure. I had been getting from friends and editors, all of those years, the types of reactions writers dread: my stories were 'interesting,' there was 'a lot going on there, for sure,' it was clear that I'd 'really worked hard on them.'

A switch got thrown in my head, and the next day I started working on a story in a new mode--allowing myself to be entertaining, setting aside my idea of what a 'classic' story sounded like ...

In this mode, I found, I had stronger opinions than when I was trying to be Hemingway. If something wasn't working, I knew what to do about it, immediately and instinctively, in the form of an impulse ... whereas before I'd been rationally *deciding,* in stiff obedience to what I thought a story should, or must, do. 

...When I finished the story, I could see it was the best thing I'd ever written. There was some essential 'me-ness' in it--for better or worse, no one else could have written it. ... The story was oddly made, slightly embarrassing--it exposed my actual taste, which, it turned out, was kind of working-class and raunchy and attention-seeking. I held the story up against the stories I loved ... and felt I'd let the form down. 

So, this moment of triumph ('I'd found my voice!') was also sad. 

It was as if I'd sent the hunting dog that was my talent out across a meadow to fetch a magnificent pheasant and it had brought back, let's say, the lower half of a Barbie doll.

To put it another way: having gone about as high up the Hemingway Mountain as I could go, having realized that even at my best I could only ever hope to be an acolyte up there ... I stumbled back down into the valley and came upon a little shit-hill labeled 'Saunders Mountain.'

'Hmm,' I thought. 'It's so *little*. And it's a *shit-hill*.'

Then again, that was my name on it. 

This is a big moment for any artist (this moment of combined triumph and disappointment), when we have to decide whether to accept a work of art that we have to admit we weren't in control of as we made it and of which we're not entirely sure we approve. It is *less*, less than we wanted it to be, and it's *more*, too--it's small and a bit pathetic judged against the work of the great masters, but there it is, all ours.

What we have to do at that point, I think, is go over, sheepishly but boldly, and stand on our shit-hill, and hope it will grow.

And--to belabor this already questionable metaphor--what will make that shit-hill grow is our commitment to it, the extent to which we say, 'Well, yes, it's a shit-hill, but it's *my* shit-hill, so let's assume that if I continue to work in this mode that is mine, this will will eventually stop being made of shit, and will grow, and from it, I will eventually be able to see (and encompass in my work) the whole world.'
