The best dialogue tends to come out of subtext, and reveal what people believe, not just act as a logical response. So write for one character as if he can only hear the 3 most important words in what the other character said... have him respond to those words as if they were a check on his worldview. Quick example:

BAD

‘Let's go out tonight, I'm just so tired of the same old stuff.’

‘Go where? And wait, what do you mean the 'same old stuff?'’

‘I mean you neeever want to try anything new.’

BETTER

‘Let's go out tonight, I'm tired of the same old stuff.’

-> TONIGHT, TIRED, SAME

‘Oh so I'm not tired? If everything I pick is the same, then you try.’

-> OH, EVERYTHING, TRY

‘All I do is try, Carl, don't OH me. Who tries harder in this relationship?’
