St Augustine \[asked] ... 'What, then, is time? Provided that no one asks me, I know. But if I want to explain it to a questioner, I am baffled.'

I've spent years attempting to answer a question that sounds equally silly: What is law? I'm a law \[and philosophy] professor, so you'd think I know. ... But if we're honest, most lawyers ... know what law is, right up until you ask, then we're baffled.

Most of my colleagues happily ignore their ignorance. They have important business to get on with. And I think they think I'm silly for getting stuck on the question. But I think we should all be silly like that sometimes. We should take a step back from our practical concerns and think like little kids. It's a way of recapturing some of the wonder they have at the world--and a way of reming ourselves how little we understand of it.
